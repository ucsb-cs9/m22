Final Exam Logistics
* In-person (HSSB 1174) Thursday 9/9 @ 9:30am - 10:50am PST
* Bring a writing utensil and a photo ID
    * PLEASE WRITE LEGIBLY
    * When leaving the room, you must present your ID and hand in
    your exam before leaving
    * Closed book (no notes / book / electronic devices)
* The final will be cummulative
* Questions
    * True / False (if false, briefly state why (1 sentence))
    * Short answer
        * Briefly define / state / describe / ...
    * Given some code, write the output
    * Write code satisfying a certain specification (short ~ 5 - 10 lines)
    * Given some algorithm we covered, fill in the blank to make it work
    * Drawing conceptual figures (trees / data structures / underlying
    lists / etc).
    * TAs and I will be proctoring the exam. We can answer CLARIFYING
    questions

Topics
* Python Basics
    * Types
        * int, float, boolean, strings, lists, sets, dictionaries,...
        * conversion functions (int(), float(), str(), ...)
        * mutable vs. immutable
    * Relational / logical operators (==, <, >, <=, >=, and, or, not, ...)
    * Python Lists
            * Supporing methods (count, pop, ...)
    * Understanding under-the-hood workings of dictionaries vs. lists
    * List / string slicing [:]
    * Strings
            * supporting methods (replace, split, find, ...)
    * Function definitions
    * Control structures
            * If, else, elif, for, while

* Testing
    * Test Driven Development (TDD)
    * pytests
* Python Errors
    * Runtime vs Syntax
* Exceptions
    * Exception types (NameError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError, ...)
    * Exception handling
        * try / except / raise
        * Flow of execution
        * Passing exceptions to the function caller
        * Catching multiple exceptions
        * Catching inherited type exceptions
* Object Oriented Programming
    * Defining Python classes and methods
    * Class constructors
        * Defining /initializing default state
    * Shallow vs. Deep Equality
        * Overloading __eq__ method
    * Overloading operators
        * __str__, __add__, __le__, ...
    * Inheritance
        * Know the implementation and inhertiance of fields / methods and how
        to override methods
        * Know the pattern on how to construct inherited classes
        * Know the hierarchy of types (deals with exceptions)
        * Know how to explicity call super / base class(es) methods
* Algorithm Analysis and O-notation
    * Know how to derive O-notation for various data structure functionality
    and code segments
* Binary Search
    * Search for items in a SORTED list
    * Know implementation and O-notation
* Recursion
    * Understanding how recursive algorithms are managed by the call stack
    * Able to derive O-notation for various recursive functions
* Linear Data Structures
    * Know implementations (as covered in textbook / lecture) and O-notation
    for various functionality
        * Stacks, Queues, Deques, Linked Lists, and Ordered Linked List
* Sorting Algorithms
    * Know the implementation and O-notation analysis (best / worst case
    scenarios)
    * Bubble sort (optimized version), Selection Sort, Insertion Sort,
    Merge Sort, and Quick Sort
* Trees
    * Terminology
    * Know min-heap / max-heap data structure and implementation (and underlying
    list representation)
    * Binary Trees
        * Know the nodes / references implementation
        * Tree traversals: pre / in / post order
    * Binary Search Trees
        * Know BST property and how insertion order affects structure
        * Know various BST methods (put, get, deletion (conceptual))
